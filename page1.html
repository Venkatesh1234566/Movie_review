    <p id="abd" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">The Conjuring 2 (known in the United Kingdom as The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case )[4][5] is a 2016 American supernatural horror film, directed by James Wan. The screenplay is by Chad Hayes, Carey W. Hayes, Wan, and David Leslie Johnson. It is the sequel to 2013's The Conjuring, the second installment in The Conjuring series, and the third installment in The Conjuring Universe franchise. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as paranormal investigators and authors Ed and Lorraine Warren from the first film. The film follows the Warrens as they travel to England to assist the Hodgson family, who are experiencing poltergeist activity at their Enfield council house in 1977 which later became referred to as the Enfield poltergeist.</font></p>

    <p id="r1" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">“The Conjuring 2” opens with notorious ghostbusters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) investigating the aftermath of the murders that became known as “The Amityville Horror.” Lorraine has a unique ability to communicate with supernatural beings and has been asked to confirm that what happened at Amityville was demonic in nature and not just a homicidal patriarch. While sitting around a table in the DeFeo dining room, Lorraine has an out-of-body experience that allows her to see the shotgun murders that took place in the house and a “Demon Nun” (Bonnie Aarons), which is literally how the recurring vision is listed in the credits, who will haunt Lorraine throughout the film, and issue a warning that Ed’s days are numbered.</font></p>
    <p id="r2" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">“Children in jeopardy, a put-upon mother, an old house. Sound familiar? It should. Wan and his screenwriters very purposefully hit many of the same beats as the first film, presenting us with a set-up that often feels too similar, and disappoints by comparison because O’Connor’s character isn’t given nearly the depth of Lili Taylor’s in the original</font><br></br>
    <img id="imgr"src="https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/gallery/the-conjuring-2/con2-fp-123.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" align="left"></p>
    <p id="r3" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)"> Taylor’s underrated work in that film helped ground the fear tactics in something real. The characters in “The Conjuring 2” are secondary, introduced with minor definition (mom worries about money, one of the boys stutters, etc.) and then put-upon enough that the Warrens have to save the day. Despite very solid work by Wolfe to capture the fear of a girl who has no idea what’s going on (as well as to be truly scary when she needs to be), the characters in “The Conjuring 2” don’t resonate, so we don’t care as much about what happens to them.Which is not to say that Wan has entirely lost his ability to scare us. </font></p>
    <p id="r2" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">“Working with ace cinematographer Don Burgess (a regular collaborator of Robert Zemeckis on everything from “Forrest Gump,” for which he won an Oscar, to “Flight”), Wan and his team have an incredible ability to produce fear with camera tricks and forced perspective. They’ll start with a shot of a room, zoom in on a face, and then quick-zoom out to reveal something crucial has changed. They avoid traditional, jump-scare edits, knowing that it’s much scarier to stay in one shot as the normal world becomes terrifying around and in it. And they love playing with supernatural POV (that floating camera above the action in the house) and with what they allow us to see.</font><br></br>
    <img id="imgr"src="https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/gallery/the-conjuring-2/conjuring22.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="300" align="right">
    <p id="r1" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">There’s a fantastic scene in which Janet may or may not be possessed by Bill in the background but Wan and Burgess stay tight on Ed Warren’s face, allowing our imaginations to work on what’s going on behind him. At its best, Wan’s incredible camera skills blend with his playfulness—the sound of someone (or something) whistling “This Old Man,” a fire engine toy moving on its own, a dog bell that every modern horror viewer knows will eventually signal menace—to create the kind of thrill ride the director is so clearly trying to replicate. He didn’t just make a film set in the ‘70s, he employs tricks of the era cinematically, recalling movies like “The Omen” and “The Shining," but with a modern eye.</font></p>
    <p id="r2" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)">“The Conjuring 2” doesn’t live up to the films that inspired it (or the original) not because of the filmmaking laziness we so often see in horror (especially sequels), but almost because Wan and company are having too much fun to streamline their film.</font><br></br>
    <img id="imgr"src="https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/gallery/the-conjuring-2/con2-04390.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" align="left"></p>
    <p id="r3" style="text-align:justify;" ><font size="5" style="color:rgb(114, 177, 183)"> The movie runs amazingly long, and could have lost at least 15 minutes to make for a tighter, scarier ride. At times, the non-stop haunting becomes numbing, lessening its ability to scare. The commitment by Wan and his team—and Farmiga and Wilson, who completely devote themselves to their sometimes-goofy roles—makes the ride worth taking, but "The Conjuring 2" can be too recognizable to get under our skin. It is an incredibly robust piece of filmmaking on a technical level, and that alone will be enough for many Wan fans (and those of us exhausted by Hollywood horror films that often show no filmmaking prowess at all), but ghost stories don’t have the same impact the second time you hear them. Even the scary ones. </font></p>
